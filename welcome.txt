Welcome!

I developed a vr school and vr hospital management system this time using WEBRTC.
I would like you to introduce this system to schools or hospitals.
Also, I would like to use skype for faster communication.

- video education system
A video education system has been developed for learners  suffering from Covid-19.
I will briefly introduce the system.
The lecturer sets a learning title and content, a learning time, and creates a learning room.
And the lecturer tell learners  (who paid for the learning fee)to room information.
In the learning room, video calls and charting are held between lecturer and learners  .
lecturer share materials such as videos and documents on the screen so that learners can see them.
(This is similar to google meeting or zoom meeting.)
I think this system can help your learn English.

- video therapy and VR hospital system
A video therapy and VR hospital system has been developed for patients suffering from Covid-19.
Wouldn't you like to run a VR hospital?
Let me briefly introduce the system.
Users know about the skills of hospitals and doctors through the VR hospital site.
In addition, users can enter the VR treatment room and receive a diagnosis through video calls with doctors. 
This system can be used not only on a computer, but also on a mobile phone, so patients can get help from doctors even when they are far away from the hospital.
Doctors simply set up a brief self-introduction and treatment section, and create a treatment room.
Then, the treatment room information will be disclosed on the site, and the patients will visit to you.
I think this system will help your business.
